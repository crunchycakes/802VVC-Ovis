# 802VVC-Ovis

the environment is a vite/react app served by a flask backend

ensure `node v22.14.0` or a similar version is installed; you may need to install several dependencies (possibly vite)

to run the backend, navigate to `/backend`, and run simply `python app.py`
- note that here, you may need to install several flask/cors modules

to run the frontend in a development mode, navigate to `/frontend`, and run `npm run dev`
